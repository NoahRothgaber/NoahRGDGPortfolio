# noah_r_gdgflutter

This project is designed to make use of the Flutter API for creating a dynamic web application. The main programming language in the backend is Dart, which emphasizes the use of containers for different application components. The code itself is object oriented in nature, and was built at the Google Development Group event in the Massachusetts area. 

The application itself, is a portfolio used to link my github page and linkedin profile.
